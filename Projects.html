<h2>ACADEMIC PROJECTS</h2>

<h3>Title: Face Classification and Verification using Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
<p><strong>Organization:</strong> Turnkey Learning<br /><strong>Description:</strong> Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to design an end-to-end system for the classification and verification of images. In the classification task, given an image of a face as input, got the ID of the face as output . For the verification task, given two images as inputs and got a score that quantifies the similarity between the faces in the given<br />images as the output.<br /><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Python Programming, Deep Learning.</p>

<h3>Title: Frame Level Classification of Speech</h3>
<p><strong>Organization:</strong> Turnkey Learning<br /><strong>Description</strong>: Provided a dataset of audio recordings (utterances) and their phoneme state (subphoneme) labels, generated predictions for the&nbsp;phonemes of the test set using feedforward neural networks.<br /><strong>Technologies used:</strong> python programming, Deep learning.<br /><strong>Libraries used:</strong> PyTorch, numpy.</p>

<h3 >Title: My torch</h3>
<p><strong>Organization:</strong> Turnkey Learning<br /><strong>Description:</strong> Developed my own version of custom deep learning<br />library,called MyTorch. It acts similar to PyTorch.<br /><strong>Libraries used:</strong> NumPy<br /><strong>Technologies used:</strong> Python programming, Deep learning.</p>

<h3 >Title: User Vitality Ranking and Prediction in Social Networking Services</h3>
<p ><strong>Goal:</strong> To predict the activeness of a person on social media.<br /><strong>Organization:</strong> Joginpally B R Engineering College.<br /><strong>Role:</strong> Team Leader.<br /><strong>Team size:</strong> Worked in a team of four members.<br /><strong>Technologies used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java.<br /><strong>Description:</strong> Worked on javascript. Deployed a website that servers as a platform to communicate. This website collects user data and predicts&nbsp;user vitality on the website.<br /><strong>Algorithms used:</strong> Initial Ranking Algorithm and Iterative Ranking Algorithm</p>

<h3 >Title: A Secure Approach for Data Hiding Using Visual Cryptography</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Share confidential images over networking in a secure way<br /><strong>Organization:</strong> Joginpally B R Engineering College.<br /><strong>Role:</strong> Team Leader.<br /><strong>Team size:</strong> Worked in a team of four members.<br /><strong>Description:</strong> I worked on backend development. Developed a website that can be used as a platform to share images online in a secure way. Gained knowledge of JavaScript.<br /><strong>Technologies used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java.</p>
